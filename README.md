The cloud computing module provided a strategic perspective on how platforms such as Microsoft Azure enable scalable, secure, and resilient data operations. Through hands‑on labs, I gained experience with:
- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Cloud storage
- Analytics services
I also learned to architect cloud‑based solutions that balance compliance, automation, and future scalability. Scenario‑based work strengthened my ability to translate business requirements into cloud architectures that support organisational growth.

# Python for Data Analysis
The Python module enhanced my technical proficiency in:
- Data manipulation
- Data exploration
- Data visualisation
using Pandas. I applied analytical logic to real‑world datasets, produced reproducible outputs, and automated elements of the analysis process. This reinforced Python’s role in modern business intelligence workflows and strengthened my ability to deliver structured, insight‑driven analysis.

# Conclusion
Collectively, this programme has significantly advanced my technical capability, analytical confidence, and strategic understanding of how data underpins effective decision‑making. I am now well equipped to contribute within a data‑driven organisation by:
- Delivering high‑quality analysis
- Designing scalable solutions
- Supporting operational and strategic objectives
- Producing robust, evidence‑based insights

# Week 1: Introduction to Data and Excel
Throughout this workbook, I strengthened my technical skills and analytical discipline across key data‑handling tools and methodologies. The exercises enabled me to practise structured techniques for data preparation, transformation, and interpretation using Excel, SQL, and visualisation methods.
I also learned to emphasise accuracy, governance, and compliance in data‑driven environments. Additionally, I improved my ability to distil complex analytical results into clear, concise insights for senior stakeholders, ensuring that recommendations are evidence‑based and commercially relevant.
This experience boosted my confidence in delivering high‑quality analysis, complying with regulatory standards, and communicating findings effectively in line with organisational expectations and professional best practices.

# Week 2: Introduction to Visual Tools — Tableau & Power BI
Over the course of this workbook, I strengthened my capability to work with modern data tools and analytical techniques while developing a structured, professional approach to interpreting and presenting insights.
The activities enabled me to apply Tableau, Excel, and Power BI in practical scenarios, reinforcing my ability to transform raw datasets into clear, meaningful outputs that support decision‑making. I also deepened my understanding of analytical methods such as:
- Trend analysis
- Moving averages
- Visual storytelling
These techniques helped me highlight performance patterns and guide strategic planning.
Beyond technical development, I gained a stronger awareness of how data informs organisational priorities—whether identifying market trends, understanding customer behaviour, or supporting public‑sector decision‑making. This week strengthened my communication skills and improved my readiness to contribute effectively in a data‑driven corporate environment.

# Week 3: Introduction to Databases and SQL
Throughout this workbook, I strengthened my understanding of core database concepts and enhanced my practical capability in applying SQL and relational database design principles to real business scenarios.
I worked through foundational topics including:
- Primary and foreign keys
- Data relationships
- Join operations
I also developed a structured approach to designing and implementing a functional database for a retail environment. This included translating business requirements into a logical schema, defining table structures, enforcing referential integrity, and using SQL to create, populate, and maintain a reliable data system.
The SQL practical tasks reinforced my ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets using targeted queries. By working through real‑world scenarios—such as demographic analysis, population trends, and geographic filtering—I strengthened my ability to write efficient queries and align technical work with business objectives.
Overall, this week enhanced my technical proficiency, improved my confidence in SQL, and strengthened my ability to deliver actionable insights that support business performance and operational efficiency.

# Week 5: Fundamentals of Microsoft Azure
Throughout this workbook, I strengthened my understanding of cloud computing principles and developed a strategic perspective on how modern cloud platforms—particularly Microsoft Azure—support data‑driven operations.
The tasks enabled me to explore:
- Cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Deployment options (public, private, hybrid, community)
- Regulatory considerations (GDPR, DPA 2018)
I deepened my knowledge of the practical benefits of cloud adoption, including scalability, cost efficiency, resilience, and improved collaboration.
Hands‑on Azure labs enhanced my technical capability in:
- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Cloud storage
- Analytics services
I also explored non‑relational data, analytics tooling, and services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Synapse Analytics.
The “Paws & Whiskers” case study strengthened my ability to translate business requirements into a structured cloud architecture, considering security, automation, backup, and scalability.
Overall, this week improved my technical confidence and strategic understanding of cloud‑based data solutions, equipping me to design compliant architectures and support organisations in leveraging Azure for efficiency and insight generation.

# Week 6: Introduction to Python for Data Analysis
Throughout this workbook, I strengthened my technical capabilities in Python programming, data manipulation, and analytical problem‑solving, while developing a structured, professional approach to working with real‑world datasets.
